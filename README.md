# AnR2
A Proof-of-Concept Project prepared in accordance to create Anonymous Routing for files/messages.

# Motivation
Inspiration for this project came from communicating with a person whom I wanted to share a message without anyone else knowing about the secret. I could've just used pre-existent methods, but where is the nerve-wracking hardwork in that ;).
